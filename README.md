# BUNNYSENSE 1.0 (SCRIPT VERSION)

the beginning! everything works.. as intended? i do have some ideas honestly but.. i, eh.. i feel a bit of pressure for now, but i have amazing ideas.. don't know where to start for now because the product is, well.. not too amazing, i'm really silly and make tons of mistakes.

# BUNNYSENSE 1.50 (REMASTERED)

i've been struggling a lot, i shouldn't have a project of this size hanging on my shoulders but here i am, giving it everything i have. Eventhough i make so many mistakes, i'm still trying and trying.
but i don't know how far trying will get me, i'm burning myself out, managing stuff gets harder and harder and i feel as if i cannot make anybody happy.
well.. i added the auto injector, some anti cheat stuff.. and the full ui rework, i hope nobody will complain this time.
